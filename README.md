# GeneQueryLab Repository

Welcome to the GeneQueryLab repository, a comprehensive suite of bioinformatics tools designed for the analysis, manipulation, and exploration of genetic sequences. Developed with precision and efficiency in mind, this repository houses tools for handling FASTA and Unigene files, querying tissue expression data, and identifying gene categorizations. It serves as an invaluable resource for bioinformaticians, geneticists, and data scientists aiming to extract meaningful insights from complex genetic data.

## Highlights

- **FASTAManipulation**: Tools for reading, analyzing, and manipulating FASTA files, including scripts for generating nucleotide statistics and splitting sequences based on structural features.
- **FASTASearch**: A collection designed to facilitate gene identification and categorization, leveraging chromosome 21 gene lists and the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee's comprehensive gene database.
- **TissueExp**: A directory dedicated to querying tissue expression data from Unigene files, supporting targeted analyses of gene expression across various tissues.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GeneQueryLab.git
```
2. Navigate to the desired tool directory within the repository.
3. Ensure Python 3.x and all necessary dependencies are installed. Dependency requirements are specified in each tool's directory.

## Usage
Each tool and script within the repository is designed to be executed from the command line. Specific usage instructions, including required arguments and options, can be found within the README.md file of each directory.

## Directory Structure
- **FASTAManipulation/**: Tools for the efficient handling and manipulation of FASTA files.
- **FASTASearch/**: Resources and scripts for gene identification and categorization.
- **TissueExp/**: Modules for querying tissue expression data from Unigene files.

### Testing
Unit tests are provided within subdirectories of each main folder, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the tools developed.
